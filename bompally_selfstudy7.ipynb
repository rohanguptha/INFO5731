              "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

              "Text xxbos xxmaj sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hands ( xxmaj wayne 's xxmaj world , the first one , not the second ) . xxmaj but most often they have duds ( xxmaj it 's xxmaj pat comes to mind rather quickly ) . xxmaj this time out it 's xxmaj tim xxmaj meadows as xxmaj the xxmaj ladies xxmaj man . xxmaj this movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud . xxmaj it was very funny for the first 20 minutes , but then , as usually happens with xxup snl skits , it starts to slow down , before finally ending , long after it should have . \n",
              " \n",
              "  xxmaj tim xxmaj meadows is xxmaj leon xxmaj phelps , a radio xxup dj with a xxunk show called xxmaj the xxmaj ladies xxmaj man . xxmaj he answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships , usually in the crudest way possible . xxmaj everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt . xxmaj after pushing the xxunk of the station manager , xxmaj leon , along with his producer xxmaj julie ( xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) gets fired , and needs to find another job . xxmaj out of the random blue , comes a letter from one of his ex - ladies . xxmaj the letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life , the only problem being that the letter is n't signed . xxmaj so xxmaj leon needs to track down all the women he 's been with to find the woman of his dreams . xxmaj but sometimes , as xxmaj billy xxmaj dee xxmaj williams says in the film , the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you . xxmaj there is also a sub - plot about a bunch of guys who 's wives / girlfriends have all slept with xxmaj leon , and they want to first figure out who he is ( by a tattoo he has on a part of his xxunk ) , then kill him . xxmaj leading this bunch of guys is , surprise ! xxmaj will xxmaj ferrell from xxup snl . xxmaj first off , i thought the sub - plot was rather lame . xxmaj the singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless . i usually like xxmaj will xxmaj ferrell but here he just never xxunk for me . xxmaj and the rest of the guys were just xxunk who xxunk along , and in the end all decided that having their wives / girlfriends xxunk on them was in fact their fault . xxmaj so back to the main story . xxmaj the story basically centers around xxmaj leon and sex . xxmaj so what it comes down to is , if you do n't like the character of xxmaj leon , you wo n't like the movie . xxmaj his voice , his mannerisms , his dialogue is what carries the movie . i am not a big fan of xxmaj tim xxmaj meadows . i never thought he was a particularly good actor on xxup snl . xxmaj the only thing i ever really liked of his , was his xxmaj ladies xxmaj man skits . xxmaj but the best thing about those , is that they usually involved the guest host ( remember the one with xxmaj cameron xxmaj diaz ? ) , and they were short . xxmaj for about 5 minutes , they were pretty funny . xxmaj and here , for about 20 minutes , it 's really funny . xxmaj what i thought was good about the character in the movie , is that he stayed in character throughout . xxmaj he never xxunk from his wanted to just get laid persona . xxmaj until right at the end where there was this transformation , and the ever present speech to tie things up . xxmaj other than that , it was pretty good at keeping xxmaj leon as xxmaj leon , and not changing him into something less crude than he was . xxmaj there is n't a lot of substance to this movie , if you could n't guess . xxmaj but like i said earlier , the beginning of the movie i found to be very funny . xxmaj some real laugh out loud moments , all xxunk around sex and his xxunk . xxmaj the problem of course with this movie , and most other xxup snl spin xxunk , is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time . xxmaj xxunk the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult . xxmaj that difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub - plot , because without it , this movie would have been a little under an hour . xxmaj when it was good , it was good , but when it was n't good , it got to be boring . \n",
              " \n",
              "  xxmaj so overall , xxmaj the xxmaj ladies xxmaj man was n't as bad as other xxup snl films , but it was n't as good as others . xxmaj it had some funny moments , the first 20 minutes was pretty good , but the rest of it dragged on . xxmaj there was an unnecessary sub - plot whose only purpose was to xxunk the film . xxmaj the bottom line is , if you like xxmaj tim xxmaj meadows and his xxmaj leon xxmaj phelps character , you 'll be able to watch the film . xxmaj if he annoys you , do n't even bother going . xxmaj unless you just want to see xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk in some nice revealing clothing . \n",
