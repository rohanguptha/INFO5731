              "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

              "  xxmaj another problem with this movie is how it 's titled \" xxmaj war of the xxmaj robots \" . which usually entails that xxmaj robots are fighting each other . xxmaj now there are robots in this movie , but they look so pathetic it 's incredibly amusing . xxmaj every robot looks exactly like a human with a blonde mullet and a silver jumpsuit . xxup fear xxup the xxup robots ! and you do n't even learn that they xxup are robots until halfway into the movie . xxmaj but the robots are n't even the main villains . xxmaj the main villains are these old people . xxmaj yeah . terrifying . if a movie is called \" xxmaj war of the robots \" then i better see robots xxup battling xxup each xxup other ! that 's like me calling the movie \" xxmaj clone xxmaj wars \" \" xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj raider battle \" . xxmaj sure they 're in there , but they 're not the main concern . \n",

' xxmaj these ideas are perhaps more suited to an xxmaj american film so it 's no wonder that after a while watching this film , things start to feel a little out of sorts . \n",

              "  xxmaj what these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore xxmaj oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they have n't done in the past , i mean a xxup beautiful xxup mind beating xxup the xxup fellowship xxup of xxup the xxup ring for gawd 's sake ! xxmaj and long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts,xxbos xxmaj this film was hard to get a hold of , and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming . i mean , this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century : an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and xxup gets xxup away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt . xxmaj with all of this built - in interest , how could anyone make such a lackluster , talk - laden flick of this true - life event . xxmaj while xxmaj williams is always interesting , the screenwriters assumed that the xxup d.b. xxmaj cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star , s what we get is a type - without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off . xxmaj harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty , but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction . xxmaj shame on this film for even existing .\n",

' xxmaj these ideas are perhaps more suited to an xxmaj american film so it 's no wonder that after a while watching this film , things start to feel a little out of sorts . \n",

              "  xxmaj the film begins and ends in the same manner , creating a feeling of a circular journey ; a circular journey that has gone absolutely nowhere and absolutely nothing has been achieved . xxmaj three blokes sit around a table talking and what - not . xxmaj their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to whatever crude and disgusting stories , situations or scenarios each can possibly think of . xxmaj the odd thing here , being that whenever one man says something nasty , the other grimaces but has an equally filthy story to give in return creating a contradiction in what these men find to cross the line and what they do not . xxmaj the men are xxmaj dave ( xxmaj vegas ) and xxmaj ferris ( xxmaj crook ) , two people joined by xxmaj xxunk ( xxmaj coleman ) whenever the film sees fit to throw in a third face to crack some more nasty sex jokes or break some peculiar stories . xxmaj they are employed by xxmaj jeremy ( xxmaj xxunk ) , a man who has deeper issues and problems but issues of which the film is more concerned with exploiting for the sake of humour rather than study . \n",
              " \n",
              "  xxmaj so what 's the situation in xxmaj sex xxmaj lives of the xxmaj potato xxmaj men ? xxmaj the three to four men are in a crisis and for the duration of the film , we will adopt the role of the hapless fly on the wall as we witness what foul play these people get up to over the period of about a week . xxmaj if the humour revolving around xxmaj dave and xxmaj ferris is disgusting and repulsive , then for xxmaj jeremy things are just spooky . xxmaj it all begins rather innocently and it appears there is a female he likes and one who equally likes him in return but when the essence that xxmaj jeremy is merely a stalker creeps in , that 's when the jaws drop . xxmaj the character of xxmaj jeremy is used and put across in a way that makes unrequited love and stalking in general merely look ' funny ' . xxmaj jeremy sits in his apartment listening to classical music and writing out letters of abuse to xxmaj ruth ( xxmaj davis ) , echoing some sort of psychotic persona more associated with xxmaj hannibal xxmaj lecter writing his letter 's to xxmaj clarice in 2001 's xxmaj hannibal . xxmaj but whatever sympathy we might have for him at this point is rendered absolutely false when , later on , it is revealed the true origin of their relationship . xxmaj suddenly , we as an audience feel cheated into feeling a mite sorry for him earlier on and for whatever reason he did do what he did in the first place just seems cowardly and distasteful . xxmaj to say what it was would ruin whatever few surprises lurk within the film . \n",
